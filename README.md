## Running the Project

As this project need the backEnd to work, we first need to run it.

- Step 1: Clone the backEnd repository if you don't have it.

    ```git clone https://github.com/AurorinhaBoreal/PersonCRUD-BackEnd.git```

- Step 2: Create the PostgreSQL container for the backEnd.

    ```docker compose up -d```

- Step 3: Run the backEnd project using gradle.

    ```gradle bootRun```

- Step 4: After these steps you can run the frontEnd Project.

    ```npm run dev```

## Developing the Project

The first part of a project is the organization of it's own creation. This topic will be for that
